					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>Launched in January 2020, the Atlanta Affordable Housing Fund is a 
						social impact fund designed to provide low interest rate gap/mezzanine financing for affordable housing projects 
						that might otherwise not be developed.
					</p>
					<p>Affordable housing is one of the most pressing issues facing our CBRE
						region. There are 340,000 households in metro Atlanta paying more than 30% of their income on housing, 
						which is not sustainable.
					</p>
					<p>
						The fund was founded by a group of highly seasoned real estate professionals. The goal is to make loans in the 3-5% interest rate range 
						to qualified developers/sponsors who will either create or preserve affordable housing units.
					</p>
					<p>
						Investors in the $25 million fund will receive an economic return, as well as a social return quantified in 
						a report card of how many affordable housing units their investment benefits.
					</p>
					<p>
						The fund is aligned with HouseATL, the City of Atlanta’s initiative to solve the affordable housing crisis in our area.
